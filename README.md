#Self Critique 
I believe that my skills from the first week of class to now have significantly increased. If you were to look at my website that I made in the first Web Design class, compared to the websites I am designing now you can see a clear transition from basic web design to somethign that is more functional and end-user friendly. I still struggle with a lot of Java-Script concepts and some CSS concepts but overall I think I have come along way. In terms of the project I believe that I had did okay at first, and as the project went along I caught on to the overall design we were going for and that really helped when I wanted to add my own personal insight.

#Jacob Critique 
Jacob was a real team player, he was really helpful in the welcome page as that was the one that he mainly worked on. The overall design was something that we all agreed on but the skeleton and features were all brought about from Jacob. Jacob did a really good job at helping the team keep on task and keep to the deadlines that the professor had put forward for the students to meet.

#Steven Critique
Steven took one for the team and worked on the most annoying web-page happily. The finance page was one that I myself would not have been super ecstatic to work on but Steven jumped on that page instantly and worked hard to design an overall better finance page for MyIIT. Steven was really good at getting his work done and trying to help out on the other pages when needed or asked. 

#Tony Critique 
Tony was a design wiz and along with Lucy was a very crucial part in making the website not look ugly. Personally I prefer the Java-Script and HTML side of web design so having someone who enjoys working with CSS was nice to have on the team. Especially someone that eventually wants to design websites as a full time job. Tony was a real leader and was one of hte main people that helped lay out the timeline of when things needed to get done.

#Lucy Critique
Lucy, similar to Tony, was very helpful in designing the website to have a welcoming and overall modern look to the site. Lucy was very communicative with the rest of the group and would help on the CSS or HTML whenever needed. Going out of her way to try and add small details to the website that she believed would make it look better overall. Lucy was a fantastic team member to have when working on recreating the MyIIT website.
